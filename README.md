# Features

## Know when installed plugins have updates

This small icon is added to the status bar:

## Evaluate the riskiness of upgrading

#### Statistics on new versions

Older versions with more downloads are likely more stable and secure

#### Wait a few days before showing updates

#### View code changes between versions of a plugin 

Clicking *Code Changes* will bring you to a page like https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview/compare/0.5.43...0.5.46#files_bucket.

<sub>⚠️ The code in the git diff may be different than what's installed. Obsidian downloads a separate `main.js` file from the github release, which the author could add any code to.</sub>

# Feature Ideas

## Keeping your update list clean
- Option to hide/dismiss a new version of a plugin
- Option to "snooze"/hide a new version of a plugin until a time that you specify
- Setting to exclude disabled plugins from update counts
- Add a toggle to show/hide disabled plugins

## Install new versions through this plugin
- Save the user from having to go to `Settings > Community Plugins > Check for Updates` to make the update

## Theme Update Tracking

## More security heuristics
- On a sandboxed machine, does building the `main.js` from source produce the same code as the github release asset?
- Were new dependencies added to `package.json`?
- Has the `main.js` github release asset been updated since the version was published?

# Checking for updates in other plugins using the API

The API used to get plugin version info is free for anyone to use. This could be helpful for alerting your plugin's users about updates in a custom way.

The API uses cacheing/servless to keep costs low, avoid hitting github rate limits, and scale automatically. Note that results are currently cached for 30 minutes so a large number of cache misses can cause high latency.
